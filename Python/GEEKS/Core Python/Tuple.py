"""Tuple

Tuples are immutable, and usually they contain a sequence of heterogeneous elements that are
accessed via unpacking or indexing.List are mutable, and their elements are usually homogeneous
and are accessed by iterating over a list.

In unpacking of tuple number of variables on left hand side should be equal to number of values in a given tuple a.

Concat of Tuple

Concat is done by use of '+' operator. Concatenation is done always from the end of the original tuple. Other arithmetic
operations do not apply on tuples.only same data types can be combined with concatenation, an error arises if a list and
tuple are combined.

Deleting a Tuple : Tuples are immutable and hence they do not allow deletion of a part of it. Entire tuples gets
deleted by the use of del() method.
