"""Monkey Patching

1. In Python, Monkey patch refers to dynamic (or run-time) modifications of a class or module.

2. We can actually change the behavior of the code at run time.

3. The main motive behind monkey patching is that the developer needs to modify or extend the behavior
of a third party product,and does not wish to maintain a private copy of the source code.

4. We just want current instance to be patched, we just want to build something
 new on top of an existing code not to replace code entirely.
