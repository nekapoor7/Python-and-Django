"""Basic Data Types"""

"""
Data types are the classification or categorization of data items.Data types represents a kind of value which 
determines what operations can be performed on that data. 

Python has the following standard or built in data types:
1. Numeric : A numeric value is any representation of data which has a numeric value. Python identifies three
types of numbers.
a. Integer : Positive or Negative whole numbers (without whole numbers)
b. Float : Any real number with floating point representation in which a fractional component is denoted
by a decimal symbol.
c. Complex number : A number with real and imaginary component represented as x+yj. a and y are float and
j as an imaginary number.

2. Boolen : Data with one of the two built-in values True and False.

3. Sequence : A sequence is an ordered collection of similar or different data types. Python has the 
following built in sequence data types:
a. String : A string value is a collection of one or more characters put in single, double,triple quotes.
b. List : A list object is an ordered collection of one or more data items, not necessary of the similar 
data types, put in square brackets.
c. Tuple: A Tuple object is an ordered collection of one or more data items, not necessary of the similar
data types, put in parenthesis.

4. Dictionary: A dictionary object is an unordered collection of data in a key:value pair form. A collection 
of such pairs is enclosed in curly brackets. For example: {1:"Harsh",2:"Neha",3:"Sam"}

type() function: Python has an in-built function type() to ascertain the data type of a certain 
value. 

Mutable and Immutable Objects:
Data objects of the above types are stored in a computer's memory for processing. Some of these values
can be modified during processing, but content of others can't be altered once they are 
created in a memory.

Number values,strings and tuple are immutable, which means their content can't altered after creation.

On the other hand, collection of items in a list or dictionary object can be modified. It is possible to 
add, delete, insert and rearrange items in a list or dictionary. Hence, they are mutable objects.

Strings :  

Accessing Character in Python : In python, individual characters of a string can be accessed by using the method of
indexing. Indexing allows negative address references to access characters from the back of the string.
