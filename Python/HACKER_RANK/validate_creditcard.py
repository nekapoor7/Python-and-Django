'''You and Fredrick are good friends. Yesterday, Fredrick received

credit cards from ABCD Bank. He wants to verify whether his credit card numbers are valid or not. You happen to be great at regex so he is asking for your help!

► It must NOT use any other separator like ' ' , '_', etc.
► It must NOT have or more consecutive repeated digits. '''
