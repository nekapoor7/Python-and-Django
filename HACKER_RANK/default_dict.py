'''The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python.
 It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container, but the only difference is that a defaultdict will have a
 default value if that key has not been set yet.
If you didn't use a defaultdict you'd have to check to see if that key exists, and if it doesn't, set it to what you want. '''
